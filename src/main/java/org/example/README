Project by: Johnathan Voss
Assignment: Software Architecture Final

Info:
For the final, I wanted to simulate a burger shop / Food court as my main project.
The final dictates that we include four patters; Strategy, Factory, Singleton, our choice.
Due to needing these four strategies included, I figured that I should divide the project
into four separate areas, each focusing on one of those strategies specifically.

Area 1 - The BURG
Area one is taking advantage of the Decorator pattern, this is the extra pattern that I
chose to include in the project.

Area 2 - The Fries
Area two will be taking advantage of the Strategy pattern.

Area 3 - The Drink
Area three will be taking advantage of the Factory pattern.

Area 4 - The Dessert
Area four will be taking advantage of the Singleton pattern.

In the end, I hope this project meets all the requirements, as it was interesting to work
like this and purposefully code to meet these patterns. One area that I think I could have
improved or done differently was instead of splitting them all up into seperate categories,
I might have been able to work on all the patterns in one main area instead. Either way, it's
a learning process, so I hope this works well.

Thanks!
